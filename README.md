I'm doing some in javascript, some in python: go figure 游누游낗游누游낗游누游낗游누游낗游누游낗
For python using the command line run - python {name-of-file}

I'm doing all of these using node version `v4.8.3`.

### To use
```
npm install
npm run jest
```

### Way I'm doing them
I figured a good way to find out if I'm doing it the right way/my code solves the problem given is to use all of the examples given as tests to help solve the problems

I'm gonna then input the data and assert it should equal any random value and whatever it says value actually is I'll take as my answer to the problem
